    <h2>Advancements in Astronomy</h2>
    <p>During the time of the Gupta dynasty, astronomy saw big changes thanks to Aryabhata. He came up with new ideas that challenged old beliefs and changed how we understand space. Aryabhata's ideas about how things move in space laid the groundwork for modern astronomy. He said the Earth is round and spins every day, going against the idea that it's flat. This gave us a new way to think about where we are in the universe.</p>
    <h2>Ideas about Planets</h2>
    <p>Aryabhata changed how we think about how planets move. He said the Earth goes around the sun in a stretched-out circle and takes about 365 days to do it. This was different from the old idea that the Earth doesn't move and is at the center of everything. He also said that the stars seem to move because the Earth spins. This changed how we understand how things work in space and set the stage for future discoveries.</p>
