    <span class="CG1">Chandra Gupta I</span> ruled India from around 320 to about 330 CE and founded the Gupta empire. He came from a family of rulers, with his grandfather being Sri Gupta. Chandra Gupta I rose to power in Magadha, in what is now Bihar, by marrying Princess Kumaradevi of the Licchavi tribe around 308 CE. This marriage expanded his influence over parts of northern Bihar and possibly Nepal. By the late 3rd century CE, India was made up of many independent states, including the Guptas and Licchavis. Their union strengthened the new kingdom's power and prestige, symbolized by special gold coins featuring both royal families.
